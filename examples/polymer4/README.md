__Polymer with Hydrodynamic Correlations and Shear Boundary Conditions__

Performs a simulation of a polymer with thermal fluctuations and hydrodynamic correlations.  
The polymer is also subjected to shearing boundary conditions.  

To run the model using selm-lammps and python interface use 

```python ./simulation_using_python.py```

To run the model using the Jupyter notebook load the file 

simulation_polymerXX.ipynb

The model geometry and simulation conditions are set in the script files.  The SELM parameters are controlled by the XML files in the ./ModelXXX directory.  

For example, the shear rate is set in the XXX.SELM_Integrator file.  The template XML files are copied by the scripts into the target simulation directory 
each time the model is run.  Adjust the output directory using codes near tag @base_dir.

Edit the ModelXXX in the script to use each of the different example models.  
* Model1: polymer subject to uniform shear.
* Model2: polymer subject to oscillating shear.

To visualize run the script ./vis_pv_XXX.sh script in the output directory which opens the model data in a Paraview session.

See the paper below for more information on the underlying hydrodynamic model, computational methods, and shearing boundary conditions.
