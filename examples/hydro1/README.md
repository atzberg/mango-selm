__Particles and Hydrodynamic Flow__

Performs a basic simulation of two particles moving through the fluid and associated hydrodynamic flow.

To run the model using selm-lammps and python interface use 

```python ./simulation_using_python.py```

To run the model using the Jupyter notebook load the file 

simulation_hydroXX.ipynb

The model geometry and simulation conditions are set in the script files.  The SELM parameters are controlled by the XML files in the ./ModelXXX directory.  

Edit the ModelXXX in the script to use each of the different example models.  
* Model1: smaller resolution fluid mesh.
* Model2: larger resolution fluid mesh.

See the paper below for more information on the underlying hydrodynamic model and computational methods.
