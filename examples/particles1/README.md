__Particle Simulation with Hydrodynamic Correlations__

Performs a basic simulation of a collection of particles with thermal fluctuations and hydrodynamic correlations.  

To run the model using selm-lammps and python interface use 

```python ./simulation_using_python.py```

To run the model using the Jupyter notebook load the file 

simulation_particlesXX.ipynb

The model geometry and simulation conditions are set in the script files.  The SELM parameters are controlled by the XML files in the ./ModelXXX directory.  

See the paper below for more information on the underlying hydrodynamic model and computational methods.
