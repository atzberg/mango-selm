### Mango-Selm: Package for Fluid-Structure Interactions and Fluctuating Hydrodynamics Simulations
Simulation codes and Jupyter Notebook and Python interface available for simulations in LAMMPS.    <br>

**Mango-Selm** is a package for performing fluid-structure interaction simulations in LAMMPS.  The package can be used for performing implicit-solvent coarse-grained simulations in molecular dynamics and for more general problems involving fluid-structure interactions subject to thermal fluctuations.  Deterministic simulations are also possible by setting temperature to zero in models.  The package includes implementations of Stochastic Eulerian Lagrangian Methods (SELMs), Stochastic Immersed Boundary Method (SIB) approaches, and other methods.  In these hybrid methods solvent/fluid mediated effects are taken into account through continuum stochastic hydrodynamic equations that are coupled to discrete microstructure degrees of freedom.  The SELM methods provide momentum conserving thermostats for these systems and approaches for resolving relaxation of hydrodynamic modes and other dissipative interactions.  For more information and to download see the webpages below.
