### Mango-Selm: Package for Fluid-Structure Interactions and Fluctuating Hydrodynamics Simulations
Jupyter Notebook and Python interface for modeling also now available for SELM-LAMMPS simulations.    <br>

**Mango-Selm** is a package for performing fluid-structure interaction simulations in LAMMPS.  The package includes methods for
* hydrodyamic coupling between particles and microstructures handled though continuum stochastic fluid equations.
* implicit-solvent coarse-grained simulations, for example colloids / polymers / membranes.
* general fluid-structure interactions subject to thermal fluctuations (immersed boundary methods / selms).
* shear boundary conditions for micro-rheology studies, for example rheology of soft materials / complex fluids.
* deterministic simulations are also possible by setting temperature parameter to zero.

Allows for SELM and Immersed Boundary Methods hydrodynamic solvers to be used in conjunction with LAMMPS.  LAMMPS provides many interaction potentials and analysis tools for modeling and simulation.  Interaction methods include particle-mesh electrostatics, common coarse-grained potentials, many-body interactions, and others.

See the webpages below for more information and to download. 

**New Python/Juputer Notebooks for Modeling and Simulations** Immersed Boundary/SELM Models now can easily be set up using Python or Jupyter Notebooks.  See the webpage below for details and tutorial video.
