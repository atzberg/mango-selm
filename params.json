The methods provide approaches to couple in a manner consistent with statistical mechanics coarse-grained degrees of freedom to continuum stochastic hydrodynamic fields.\r\n\r\nSelm provides a collection of numerical methods integrated with the LAMMPS-MD package based on Stochastic Eulerian Lagrangian Methods.\r\n\r\nMango provides a user interface and scripting language for the specification of models and numerical simulations for the Selm package.\r\n\r\nThis website serves as the main repository for information concerning the code development of Mango-Selm. For more information concerning how to the use the software and information about the numerical methods see the Mango-Selm Homepage http://mango-selm.org/.\r\n\r\nUsers of this package should cite:\r\n\r\n\"Stochastic Eulerian Lagrangian Methods for Fluid Structure Interactions with Thermal Fluctuations,\" P.J.

Author your page content here [using GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new `gh-pages` branch locally. If you’re using GitHub Desktop, simply sync your repository and you’ll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and we’ll help you sort it out.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
