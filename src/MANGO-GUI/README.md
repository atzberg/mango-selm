# MANGO-GUI

Author: Paul J. Atzberger et al., http://atzberger.org/

Graphical User Interface (GUI) in Java for constructing models for simulations of fluid-structure interactions.

MANGO can be used to construct models for simulations of general fluid-structure interactions subject to thermal fluctuations using Stochastic Immersed Boundary Methods (SIB) and Stochastic Eulerian Lagrangian Methods (SELM).  The thermal fluctuations also can optionally be turned off to perform Immersed Boundary simulations for determinstic fluid flows.
