- Name resolution when loading Lagrangian / Eulerian / Coupling Op lists.

- Empty panels for Lagrangian data types for which no GUI is yet developed.
(similarly for other data types).


- Removing Lagrangian should modify interactions (remove all involving)

- Selection and move points appears to act in a "Sticky manner."

- Export selected Lagrangian DOF.

- Move points (OK to leave for just current select, otherwise too confusing
with different points for different types).

- Ensure that the names for each type are setup uniquely 

- XML messages shown when doing import data for some reason.

- XML vs other file naming conventions.

- XML import Lagrangian should automatically determine the type from
  internal file specification (typeStr).

- Render control background color and gradient.

- Fancy plotting gradient (sphere).

- Toolbar docking control.

- Messages output to textbox instead of just standard out...

- Dump to XML the entire set of data for the model.
   - Save Project and Open Project.

- Implement at least one Coupling Operator type.


- New Project clear
    - Issue warning box and then clear all data.

- Reading of classes available, see URLS  (Maybe better just to have text file which registers all classes available)

- Icons for New Project, Open Project, Save Project, Generate Simulation Files, About, Help.

- Menu Item for check for updates, report bug, feature suggestion, etc...

- Work out good convention for how edit dialogues influence the render pane.  Maybe dock
  buttons below the display for editing. ?


- Interactions linking via using Lagrangian names.  If name is not found, then
  do not include the specified interaction.

- Help button in context.  Also have link to Help page on-line.
