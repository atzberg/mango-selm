**Provides numerical simulation codes and modelling software for fluctuating hydrodynamics based simulations of implicit-solvent coarse-grained models.  The methods provide approaches to couple in a manner consistent with statistical mechanics coarse-grained degrees of freedom to continuum stochastic hydrodynamic fields.**

**Selm** provides a collection of numerical methods integrated with the LAMMPS-MD package based on Stochastic Eulerian Lagrangian Methods.

**Mango** provides a user interface and scripting language for the specification of models and numerical simulations for the Selm package.

This website serves as the main repository for information concerning the code development of Mango-Selm.  For more information concerning how to the use the software and information about the numerical methods see the Mango-Selm Homepage
